Sairam! Let the SevaLink Project begin!

With Swamiji's Blessings: SevaLink will have the following mission:

1. Problem: People currently identify with one center rather than Chinmaya Mission as a whole. CHYKs graduate the program and move only to find it difficult to connect to the center near them.
2. Mission: To connect the Members of Chinmaya Mission, especially CHYKs, to Mission centers around the world but near where they are at the moment and provide them with opportunities to participate in Seva projects.
3. Purpose: So the Members of Chinmaya Mission can identify with the whole instead of a part and our community can flourish as a whole rather than as many components.
